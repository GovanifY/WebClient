ProtonMail Web Client
=======

#### [https://protonmail.ch](https://protonmail.ch)

Official AngularJS web client for ProtonMail users.

### Basic Installation
1. `sudo npm install` (requires nodejs)
2. `sudo bower install --allow-root` (choose ~angular 1.4.4 if prompted)
3. `grunt --prod` to start the app locally at `localhost:8080`

There is a very good chance you won't be able to use the app locally because of various security headers and such. But you should be able to get the code running enough to poke around and inspect it.

We are still in Beta and will have a more refined build process, installation instructions, unit tests, and all that good stuff once we exit Beta.

### Development
We are very open to bug reports via Issues as well as Pull Requests.
